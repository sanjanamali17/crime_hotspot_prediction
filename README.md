# 🛡️ Crime Analysis & Crime Hotspot Detection (India)
### Project Overview
Crime data is often available in raw tables, which makes it difficult for common users, researchers, and authorities to understand patterns and trends.
This project converts raw crime data into meaningful insights using data analysis, visualization, and an interactive web app built with Streamlit.

### The dashboard helps users:
Understand crime trends across Indian cities
Identify crime hotspots
Compare crime levels visually on a map
Gain year-wise and city-wise insights

## Problem Statement
Large crime datasets are hard to interpret
Static reports do not provide interactive exploration
No easy way to visually compare crime risk across cities

## Solution
This project provides an interactive Streamlit-based web application that:
Analyzes crime data using Python
Visualizes patterns using charts and maps
Highlights crime hotspots using color-coded risk levels
Makes data easy to understand for non-technical users

### Application Features
🌍 Crime Hotspot Map

Interactive India map using Folium
Cities marked based on crime intensity
Color-coded risk levels:

🔴 High Risk (Top 25% crime cities)
🟠 Medium Risk
🟢 Low Risk

Risk levels are relative, ensuring fair comparison
📅 Year wise Analysis
Crime data analyzed across years (e.g., 2025)
Helps understand how crime patterns change over time

## Key Concepts Used
Data Cleaning & Aggregation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Percentile-based risk classification
Interactive geospatial visualization

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Streamlit: Web application framework
Pandas: Data analysis
Matplotlib / Seaborn: Charts
Folium: Interactive maps
Streamlit-Folium: Map rendering
